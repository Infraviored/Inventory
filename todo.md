**Cleanup Strategy & "One Location Component":**

It's generally not advisable to merge all location-related functionalities into a single monolithic "location" React component. The current separation (`LocationForm`, `LocationManagement`, `LocationCarousel`, `LocationViewer`) reflects different UI responsibilities and use cases. For example, the form to *edit* a location (`LocationForm` + `RegionMapper`) is very different from a carousel to *select* a location (`LocationCarousel`).

The "cleanup" should focus on:

1.  **Consistency**: Ensuring that wherever a location's image and regions are displayed (view-only or for selection), it uses `LocationViewer` or a `RegionMapper` (in a specific mode) to maintain visual and coordinate consistency. This is what we started with the `RegionSelector` and `ItemPage` dialog.
2.  **Clear Props and Responsibilities**: Ensuring each component has a well-defined job and communicates through clear props.
3.  **Avoiding Redundant Logic**: The `useImageDisplayCoordinates` hook is a good example of shared logic that was initially duplicated. `LocationViewer` now centralizes much of the pure display logic.

No major component deletions seem immediately obvious *yet*, but by refactoring `InventoryItemForm.tsx` to use `RegionMapper` in a new way, we might find that some intermediate components or logic become redundant.

## Phase 2: Implementing Changes for `/add-item` Flow

Here's the detailed plan based on your requirements:

**1. Modify `LocationCarousel.tsx` (Minor - for now)**

*   **Goal**: For the initial request, ensure it correctly calls `onSelectLocation` with the chosen `locationId`.
*   **Future Enhancement (out of scope for immediate next step unless critical)**: Modifying it to show multiple location images simultaneously can be a significant UI/UX and implementation change. We can address this as a separate step if needed. For now, the existing single-image-at-a-time carousel will work for the interaction flow.

**2. Modify `InventoryItemForm.tsx` (Major Refactor)**

*   **State Variables:**
    *   `currentView: 'carousel' | 'regionSelection' | 'noLocationSelectedYet'` (or similar to manage flow). Initially `'carousel'` if it's a new item, or potentially `'regionSelection'` if `initialData` has a `locationId`.
    *   `selectedLocationForMapping: Location | null` (stores the full location object chosen from the carousel, needed for its `imagePath` and existing `regions` to pass to `RegionMapper`).
    *   The existing `locationId` and `regionId` states will be updated by this new flow.

*   **Workflow Logic:**
    *   **Initial Display (`useEffect` or initial state setting):**
        *   If adding a new item (`!initialData?.locationId`), set `currentView = 'carousel'`. Fetch all locations for the carousel.
        *   If editing an item with an existing `locationId` (`initialData?.locationId`), set `selectedLocationForMapping` by fetching that location's details (including its regions). Set `currentView = 'regionSelection'`.
    *   **Rendering based on `currentView`:**
        *   If `currentView === 'carousel'`:
            *   Render `<LocationCarousel locations={allLocations} onSelectLocation={handleLocationSelectedFromCarousel} />`.
        *   If `currentView === 'regionSelection'` and `selectedLocationForMapping` is set:
            *   Render `<RegionMapper imageSrc={selectedLocationForMapping.imagePath} initialRegions={selectedLocationForMapping.regions || []} onRegionSelect={handleRegionSelectedFromMapper} selectionModeOnly={true} />` (new props for `RegionMapper`).
            *   Render a "Change Location" or "Back to Carousel" button that sets `currentView = 'carousel'`, `selectedLocationForMapping = null`, `locationId = undefined`, `regionId = undefined`.
    *   **Handler `handleLocationSelectedFromCarousel(locationId: number)`:**
        *   Set the main `locationId` state for the form.
        *   Fetch the full `Location` object (including its `imagePath` and `regions`) using `getLocationById(locationId)`.
        *   Set `selectedLocationForMapping` with this fetched location.
        *   Set `currentView = 'regionSelection'`.
        *   Set `regionId = undefined` (as a new region needs to be selected from the mapper).
    *   **Handler `handleRegionSelectedFromMapper(selectedRegion: Region | null)` (new prop for `RegionMapper`):**
        *   If `selectedRegion` is not null, set the main `regionId` state for the form to `selectedRegion.id`.
        *   If `selectedRegion` is null (e.g., user explicitly clears selection in mapper or location has no regions), set `regionId = undefined`.
        *   The form can now be submitted.

**3. Modify `RegionMapper.tsx` (Significant Additions/Modifications)**

*   **New Props:**
    *   `selectionModeOnly?: boolean` (default `false`).
    *   `onRegionSelect?: (region: Region | null) => void` (this callback will be used instead of `onComplete` when in `selectionModeOnly`).
    *   `highlightedRegionId?: string | null` (to visually indicate the currently selected region in selection mode).
*   **Conditional Rendering/Behavior based on `selectionModeOnly`:**
    *   **If `true`:**
        *   Hide "Add Region" button.
        *   Hide settings popover (magnetism, colors).
        *   In `RegionDisplay` (via a prop like `isEditing={false}` or by virtue of `selectionModeOnly` in `RegionMapper`):
            *   Do not show duplicate/delete buttons.
            *   Do not show resize handles.
        *   `RegionList`:
            *   Do not show edit/delete buttons in the list.
            *   Clicking a region name in the list should call `onRegionSelect`.
        *   Clicking a region directly on the image:
            *   Should select it (update `highlightedRegionId` which `RegionMapper` will manage internally and pass to `RegionDisplay`).
            *   Call `onRegionSelect` with the clicked region's data.
        *   Disable drawing new regions (`isCreating` state should be forced to `false` or drawing handlers disabled).
        *   Disable drag/move/resize of existing regions.
        *   The "name region" popover/form should not appear or be disabled.
    *   **If `false` (current behavior):**
        *   All existing editing functionalities remain active.
        *   `onComplete` prop is used.

This is a substantial set of changes. I recommend proceeding step-by-step.

**Next Steps - Suggested Order:**

1.  **Modify `RegionMapper.tsx`** to introduce the `selectionModeOnly` prop and the conditional logic to disable editing features and enable selection behavior (calling `onRegionSelect`). This is the most complex part.
2.  **Modify `InventoryItemForm.tsx`** to implement the new state (`currentView`, `selectedLocationForMapping`) and workflow (show carousel, then show `RegionMapper` in selection mode).
3.  Ensure `LocationCarousel.tsx` correctly provides the selected `locationId`.

The API `params.id` error is still a background concern. If it persists after these changes and a server restart, we'll need to isolate it. However, the primary focus of your request is the UI/UX flow change.

Are you ready to start with modifying `RegionMapper.tsx` for the `selectionModeOnly` functionality? This will involve adding new props and a lot of conditional rendering/logic. It's a good place to start as it's central to the new flow.
